-----------------
Goals for future.


-Basic GUI
	a basic interface for a non programmer to simply input the data into boxes.
	user can add and take away  input boxes with a button click. (basic HTML DAWG)

- Distance to work.
	use MPG of Current Car and distance to work to 
	figure out econimic estimate of the cost of gas and factor that into the "True" 
	cost of living. (introduce google API)

- Untilities variables update.
	ppt can input thier own values assement for posible electric gas, water usage.
	(outside API for utilities)

	

-heat and cooling source.
	some utilites include heat seperate from gas or electric.
	if you can find out if the Heat/AC is gas or electric this can 
	heavily change variables and provided better accuracy. 
	For the cost of a year. (additional function  triggered by if statement.)
 
-Magic input!
	instead of manually typing in each property on at a time into a GUI.
	User can simply input the URL.  and the Program will go to the website and 
	search for the Proper input itself. ( reg EXpressions/ajax or jquery  and it's called scrapping)adme  good readme will be up 3.30. have to get from work.
